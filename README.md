## Getting Started

Once you have the package installed into your test project, a standard wire-up will look like this.

```csharp
	var host = HostFactory.New(x =>
	{
	    x.UseNLog();
	    
	    x.Service<SampleService>(s =>
	    {
	        s.ConstructUsing(settings => new SampleService());
	        s.WhenStarted(service => service.Start());
	        s.WhenStopped(service => service.Stop());
	        s.WithNancyEndpoint(x, c =>
	        {
	            c.AddHost(port: 8080);
	        });
	    });
	    x.StartAutomatically();

## Documentation

### URL Reservations

When you host a website within IIS, reserving a URL so that traffic is directed to your IIS website and not a different website on the machine is done for you.  It's something you don't event think about. This is called a URL Reservation, and a new URL Reservation is added via the command `netsh http add url=url user=user`

The Nancy Self Host does this for you too, however `netsh` needs Administrator privileges. Normally Windows services run in a less permissive context (as Network Service or Local Service) so the only time to add a URL Reservation is during install as installing a service requires Administrator privileges.  

If your service is running with restrictive permissions then you can specify that URL Reservations be created at install time like so. 

```csharp
s.WithNancyEndpoint(x, c =>
{
    c.AddHost(port: 8080);
	c.CreateUrlReservationsOnInstall();
});
	
```

By default any URL Reservations added will also be deleted when the service is uninstalled.
